This website is a personal hub for my notes, ideas, and resources. It is built to organize information in a way that is easy to navigate and expand over time.

## What you'll find here

- **Personal Notes**: Ideas, thoughts, and reflections on various topics
- **Learning Resources**: Summaries, guides, and references for subjects I'm studying
- **Projects:** Documentation and notes on personal projects as well as other things I am working on

The goal of this website is to create a structured, searchable, and easily expandable space for all my notes and learning materials.
