# Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes readability and simplicity.

## Key Features

- **Interpreted:** Runs code line by line; no compilation step required.
- **Dynamically typed:** Variables donâ€™t require explicit type declarations.
- **High-level syntax:** Easy to read and write.
- **Large standard library:** Includes modules for everything from web development to data analysis.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and more.

## Sample Code

```python
# Hello World in Python
print("Hello, World!")

# Simple function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))

```
