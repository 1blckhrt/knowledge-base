# Python Dictionary Methods - Complete Guide

Dictionaries are one of Python's most powerful and commonly used data structures. They store data as key-value pairs, making them perfect for mapping relationships and fast lookups.

## Sample Dictionary

Throughout this guide, we'll use this example dictionary where keys are words and values are their character counts:

```python
WORDS = {"HELLO": 5, "WORLD!": 6, "PYTHON": 6}
```

## Essential Dictionary Methods

### 1. Accessing Keys with `.keys()`

The `.keys()` method returns all dictionary keys as a view object:

```python
# Print all words
for word in WORDS.keys():
    print(word)
# Output:
# HELLO
# WORLD!
# PYTHON

# Convert to list if needed
word_list = list(WORDS.keys())
print(word_list)  # ['HELLO', 'WORLD!', 'PYTHON']
```

### 2. Accessing Values with `.values()`

The `.values()` method returns all dictionary values:

```python
# Print all character counts
for count in WORDS.values():
    print(count)
# Output:
# 5
# 6
# 6

# Find the maximum word length
max_length = max(WORDS.values())
print(f"Longest word has {max_length} characters")
```

### 3. Accessing Key-Value Pairs with `.items()`

The `.items()` method returns key-value pairs as tuples:

```python
# Print both keys and values
for word, length in WORDS.items():
    print(f"'{word}' has {length} characters")
# Output:
# 'HELLO' has 5 characters
# 'WORLD!' has 6 characters
# 'PYTHON' has 6 characters
```

### 4. Safe Value Access with `.get()`

Instead of using brackets `[]`, use `.get()` to avoid KeyError exceptions:

```python
guess = input("Enter a word: ")

# Using brackets (can raise KeyError)
if guess in WORDS:
    print(f"'{guess}' has {WORDS[guess]} characters")

# Using .get() (safer approach)
char_count = WORDS.get(guess)
if char_count:
    print(f"'{guess}' has {char_count} characters")
else:
    print(f"'{guess}' not found in dictionary")

# .get() with default value
char_count = WORDS.get(guess, 0)
print(f"'{guess}' has {char_count} characters")
```

### 5. Removing Items with `.pop()`

The `.pop()` method removes a key and returns its value:

```python
guess = input("Enter a word to remove: ")

if guess in WORDS:
    removed_count = WORDS.pop(guess)
    print(f"Removed '{guess}' (had {removed_count} characters)")
    print(f"Remaining words: {list(WORDS.keys())}")
else:
    print(f"'{guess}' not found")

# .pop() with default value (avoids KeyError)
removed_count = WORDS.pop(guess, None)
if removed_count:
    print(f"Removed '{guess}'")
else:
    print(f"'{guess}' was not in the dictionary")
```

### 6. Removing Last Item with `.popitem()`

Removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair:

```python
if WORDS:
    last_word, last_count = WORDS.popitem()
    print(f"Removed last item: '{last_word}' ({last_count} characters)")
```

### 7. Clearing All Items with `.clear()`

Removes all items from the dictionary:

```python
# Clear the entire dictionary
WORDS.clear()
print(WORDS)  # Output: {}
```

### 8. Adding Multiple Items with `.update()`

Add multiple key-value pairs at once:

```python
# Add new words
new_words = {"CODE": 4, "DEBUG": 5, "SYNTAX": 6}
WORDS.update(new_words)

# Or update with keyword arguments
WORDS.update(VARIABLE=8, FUNCTION=8)

print(WORDS)
```

### 9. Creating Shallow Copy with `.copy()`

Create a shallow copy of the dictionary:

```python
words_backup = WORDS.copy()
print(f"Original: {WORDS}")
print(f"Copy: {words_backup}")
```

## Practical Example: Word Guessing Game

Here's a complete example combining multiple dictionary methods:

```python
def word_game():
    words = {"PYTHON": 6, "CODE": 4, "DEBUG": 5, "SYNTAX": 6}
    score = 0

    print("Guess words and earn points equal to their length!")
    print(f"Available words: {len(words)}")

    while words:
        guess = input("\nEnter a word (or 'quit' to exit): ").upper()

        if guess == 'QUIT':
            break

        points = words.pop(guess, None)
        if points:
            score += points
            print(f"Correct! You earned {points} points.")
            print(f"Total score: {score}")

            if words:
                print(f"Words remaining: {len(words)}")
            else:
                print("Congratulations! You guessed all words!")
        else:
            print("Word not found or already guessed.")

    print(f"\nFinal score: {score}")

# Run the game
word_game()
```

## Key Takeaways

- Use `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` to iterate over different parts of dictionaries
- Prefer `.get()` over bracket notation for safe key access
- Use `.pop()` to remove and retrieve values safely
- Dictionary methods return view objects, not lists (except `.pop()` and `.popitem()`)
- Most dictionary operations are O(1) average case, making them very efficient

## Common Patterns

```python
# Check if dictionary is empty
if not my_dict:
    print("Dictionary is empty")

# Get all keys as a list
keys_list = list(my_dict.keys())

# Count occurrences
word_count = {}
for word in text.split():
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1

# Dictionary comprehension with items()
reversed_dict = {v: k for k, v in original_dict.items()}
```
