A network interface controller (nic) is a hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a network.

A NIC is also referred to as:

- a network interface card
- network adapter
- LAN adapter
- physical network interface

It provides the physical and logical interface between a computer (or other device) and an Ethernet network.

- Each NIC is uniquely identified by a MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is permanently assigned to it by the manufacturer.
- In addition, each ethernet NIC can be additionally configured with an IP (Internet protocol) address, enabling logical communication across different networks.

Examples:

- An ethernet NIC is a type of network interface controller designed specifically for wired Ethernet connections (such as the Internet)
- A wireless NIC is a network interface controller which connects to a wireless network, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LTE (4G) or 5G rather than a wired (Ethernet) network
