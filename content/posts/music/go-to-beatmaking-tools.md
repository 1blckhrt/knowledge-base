## Confession

Let me be real: I used to be — and kind of still am — a plugin and drumkit hoarder.

Every week I'd download some new synth, effect, or kit I saw on YouTube, telling myself _this one’s gonna make my beats better_. The truth? Most of them just collected dust and wasted space on my drive.

Now, after years of making beats, I stick to a specific toolkit — things I **actually know**, **actually use**, and **actually finish beats** with.

So instead of giving you a giant list of every plugin under the sun, here’s my **honest, go-to setup** — the stuff I reach for every time I make a beat.

## My Toolkit

### 🎹 VST Instruments

I mainly use **three plugins** to make melodies — they cover pretty much every genre I work in:

- **Serum**
  The industry standard for electronic sounds.

- **Spire**
  Harsh leads and plucks — especially when soaked in reverb and delay.

- **Zenology**
  A solid mix of synthetic and realistic sounds.

> Plugins like Omnisphere and Analog Lab are amazing — no hate — but I get lost browsing presets for hours.
> I’d rather just pick a sound I know and get going.

### 🎛 VST Effects

- **Fruity Parametric EQ 2**:
  Stock EQ — gets the job done. What more do you need?

- **Fruity Delay 3**:
  Stock delay with tons of tweakability.

- **Fruity Convolver** (Blur Pink & Blur White presets):
  Great for turning anything into a pad.

- **Gross Beat**:
  Time and volume-based effects — think stutter, half-speed, and glitch.

> That’s it. You don’t need super expensive plugins to make clean, creative beats. These just work.

### 🥁 Drumkits

- **Timeless** & **Winternite** kits by Nightiger:
  Perfect for anything digicore or hyperpop-adjacent.

- **My personal kit**:
  A custom set I built from favorite sounds across other kits + some I've designed myself.

## Why I Ignore the Rest

Most plugins are either distractions or cash grabs.

It’s tempting to believe a new plugin will make your beats better. But limiting your tools forces you to actually **get better**. You learn:

- Sound design
- Layering
- EQ and dynamics
- Creative problem-solving

I’d rather master **5 tools** than barely use **50**. The more familiar I am with my tools, the faster I move — and the more music I actually make.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re just starting out (or even years in), here’s my advice:

- 🎯 Figure out what tools you use the most
- 🧠 Learn them deeply
- 🎵 Focus on making music — not collecting plugins

Your best beats won’t come from the newest plugin.
They’ll come from **locking in** with the tools you trust and just **creating**.
